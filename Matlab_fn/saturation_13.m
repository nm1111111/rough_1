% Description:  Saturation excess flow from a store with different degrees 
%               of saturation (normal distribution variant)
% Constraints:  -
% @(Inputs):    p1   - soil depth where 50% of catchment contributes to overland flow [mm]
%               p2   - soil depth where 16% of catchment contributes to overland flow [mm]
%               S    - current storage [mm]
%               In   - incoming flux [mm/d]
