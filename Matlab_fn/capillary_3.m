% Description:  Capillary rise scaled by receiving store's deficit up to a storage threshold
% Constraints:  f <= S2
% @(Inputs):    p1   - base capillary rise rate [mm/d]
%               p2   - threshold above which no capillary flow occurs [mm]
%               S1   - current storage in receiving store [mm]
%               S2   - current storage in supplying store [mm]
%               dt   - time step size [d]
